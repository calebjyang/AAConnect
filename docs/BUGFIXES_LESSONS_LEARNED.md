## üõ†Ô∏è Refactoring Admin for Native/Static Deployment (July 2025)

### **Problem**
The admin dashboard originally relied on Next.js API routes (e.g., `/api/admin/verify`) and the Firebase Admin SDK for admin verification. This approach is incompatible with static exports and native deployment (e.g., Capacitor), since API routes and server-side code are not available.

### **Solution**
- **Moved admin verification to client-side:**  
  Instead of calling an API route, the app now checks for an admin document in Firestore using the Firebase client SDK.
- **Removed all server-side dependencies:**  
  Deleted the API route, removed the `firebase-admin` SDK, and cleaned up related code.
- **Relied on Firestore security rules:**  
  Firestore rules ensure only the authenticated user can read their own admin status, maintaining security.

### **Key Code Change**
```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE: Server-side API route for admin check
const response = await fetch('/api/admin/verify', { ... });

// ‚úÖ AFTER: Client-side Firestore check
const adminRef = doc(db, "admins", firebaseUser.email || '');
const adminSnap = await getDoc(adminRef);
const isAdmin = adminSnap.exists();
```

### **Lessons Learned**
1. **Static/Native compatibility:**  
   Avoid server-side code and API routes if you need static export or native builds.
2. **Security can be enforced with Firestore rules:**  
   You don‚Äôt need server-side admin checks if your Firestore rules are strict.
3. **Simpler deployment:**  
   Removing server-side code means easier hosting (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Capacitor, etc.).
4. **Bundle size and performance:**  
   Removing `firebase-admin` and API code reduces bundle size and complexity.

### **Testing**
- Verified that `npm run build` and `npx cap sync` work with no errors.
- Confirmed admin dashboard works when opening `index.html` directly.

## üö® Critical Bug: Collection Name Mismatch (July 2025)

### **Problem Description**
Admin dashboard was not displaying ride signups, specifically "Fall Week 1" and other recent signups. Users reported seeing "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors, and even with open Firestore rules, the admin interface showed empty results.

### **Root Cause Analysis**
**Collection Name Inconsistency**: The application was using two different Firestore collection names:
- **Public ride signup form**: Writing to `rides` collection
- **Admin dashboard**: Reading from `rideSignups` collection

This mismatch meant:
- New signups went to `rides` collection
- Admin dashboard looked in `rideSignups` collection
- Result: Admin dashboard showed empty results despite successful signups

### **Debugging Process**

1. **Initial Investigation**: Checked Firestore rules, authentication, and project configuration
2. **Environment Variables**: Verified all Firebase config values were correct
3. **Collection Discovery**: Found the mismatch through code review
4. **Testing**: Confirmed fix by updating admin code to use `rides` collection

### **Solution**
```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE: Admin reading from wrong collection
const querySnapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, 'rideSignups'));

// ‚úÖ AFTER: Admin reading from correct collection
const querySnapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, 'rides'));
```

### **Key Lessons Learned**

1. **Collection Naming Consistency**: Always use the same collection names across your entire application
2. **Systematic Debugging**: When facing "permission" errors, check collection names before diving into complex rule debugging
3. **Code Review**: Regular code reviews can catch these inconsistencies early
4. **Testing Strategy**: Test both write and read operations to ensure data flow works end-to-end

### **Prevention Strategies**
- Use constants for collection names
- Implement collection name validation
- Add integration tests that verify data flow
- Document collection naming conventions

## üéØ Drag-and-Drop Implementation: Bug Fixes & Lessons Learned

**Project**: AAConnect MVP - Carpool Management System  
**Feature**: Admin Drag-and-Drop Carpool Editing  
**Technology Stack**: Next.js, React, @dnd-kit, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
**Date**: July 2025  

---

## üìã Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive debugging journey for implementing a drag-and-drop carpool editing system in AAConnect. The feature allows admins to manually adjust automatic carpool assignments by dragging riders between cars and an unassigned area. The implementation involved solving 8 major technical challenges, providing valuable insights into React state management, drag-and-drop UX, and systematic debugging approaches.

---

## üéØ Feature Requirements

- **Drag riders between cars** - Move passengers between different vehicles
- **Drag to/from unassigned** - Handle overflow riders in a dedicated area
- **Visual feedback** - Clear drag preview that matches original elements
- **Error handling** - Graceful handling of invalid drop scenarios
- **Performance** - Smooth, responsive interactions without lag

---

## üö® Critical Bugs & Solutions

### 1. **Snap-Back Issue** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Problem**: Riders would "snap back" to their original position when dragged out of containers.

**Root Cause**: Incorrect use of `SortableContext` for multi-container drag operations. `SortableContext` is designed for sorting within a single container, not moving items between containers.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG: SortableContext for each car
<SortableContext items={carRiders}>
  <CarDroppable>
    <SortableRider />
  </CarDroppable>
</SortableContext>

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Direct droppable containers
<CarDroppable>
  <SortableRider />
</CarDroppable>
```

**Lesson**: Understand library primitives thoroughly. `SortableContext` ‚â† `useDroppable` - they serve different purposes.

---

### 2. **Disappearing Cards Bug** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Problem**: Riders would completely disappear when dropped in invalid locations.

**Root Cause**: Incomplete error handling in `handleDragEnd`. Riders were removed from source but not added anywhere, effectively losing data.

**Solution**:
```typescript
function handleDragEnd(event: DragEndEvent) {
  // Remove rider from source
  const rider = removeFromSource(activeId);
  
  // Try to add to destination
  if (isValidDropLocation(overId)) {
    addToDestination(rider, overId);
  } else {
    // ‚ùå MISSING: Revert the move
    revertToOriginalPosition(rider, sourceLocation);
  }
}
```

**Lesson**: Always provide fallback behavior for edge cases. Users will drop items in unexpected places.

---

### 3. **Cannot Drag to Empty Cars** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem**: Empty cars weren't recognized as valid drop targets.

**Root Cause**: Drop zones weren't properly registered for empty containers. Collision detection couldn't find valid targets.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Ensure each car container is a droppable zone
function CarDroppable({ id, children, ...props }) {
  const { setNodeRef } = useDroppable({ id });
  return (
    <div ref={setNodeRef} id={id} {...props}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Lesson**: Drop zones must exist independently of their contents. Empty containers should still be droppable.

---

### 4. **React Rules of Hooks Violation** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem**: "Rules of Hooks" error when calling `useDroppable` inside a map function.

**Root Cause**: React hooks must be called at the top level of components, not inside loops or conditions.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Hook in map
{assignments.map((assignment, index) => {
  const { setNodeRef } = useDroppable({ id: `car-${index}` }); // ERROR
  return <div ref={setNodeRef}>...</div>;
})}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Separate component
function CarDroppable({ id, children }) {
  const { setNodeRef } = useDroppable({ id }); // Top level
  return <div ref={setNodeRef}>{children}</div>;
}
```

**Lesson**: Always follow React's Rules of Hooks. Extract hook logic into separate components when needed.

---

### 5. **Oversized/Distorted Drag Preview** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem**: Drag preview was much larger and distorted compared to original elements.

**Root Cause**: `@dnd-kit`'s default overlay renders in a portal without inheriting original context styles.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Custom DragOverlay with exact styling
<DragOverlay>
  {activeId ? (
    <div className="exact-same-styles-as-original">
      {/* Custom content matching original */}
    </div>
  ) : null}
</DragOverlay>
```

**Lesson**: Drag-and-drop libraries often require custom styling for visual consistency.

---

### 6. **Height Changes During Drag** ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW PRIORITY**

**Problem**: Drag preview was shorter than original card.

**Root Cause**: Fixed width constraints (240px) caused text wrapping and height changes.

**Solution**: Removed fixed width, let overlay size naturally.

**Lesson**: Fixed dimensions can break responsive layouts. Let elements size themselves when possible.

---

### 7. **Duplicate Drag Previews** ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW PRIORITY**

**Problem**: Both default and custom overlays showing simultaneously.

**Root Cause**: Original element wasn't hidden during drag.

**Solution**:
```typescript
className={`${isDragging ? 'invisible' : ''}`}
```

**Lesson**: Ensure only one drag preview is visible to avoid confusing UX.

---

### 8. **Cannot Drag to/from Unassigned** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem**: Unassigned area wasn't functioning as a drop zone.

**Root Cause**: Unassigned area needed explicit droppable registration.

**Solution**:
```typescript
function UnassignedDroppable({ children }) {
  const { setNodeRef } = useDroppable({ id: 'unassigned' });
  return <div ref={setNodeRef}>{children}</div>;
}
```

**Lesson**: All potential drop destinations must be explicitly registered.

---

## üîß Technical Implementation Patterns

### State Management
```typescript
// Track active drag state
const [activeId, setActiveId] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Immutable state updates
const newAssignments = { ...editingAssignments };
newAssignments.assignments = newAssignments.assignments.map(a => ({
  ...a,
  riders: [...a.riders],
}));
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
// Graceful fallback for invalid drops
if (!validDropLocation) {
  revertToOriginalPosition(rider, sourceLocation);
}
```

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Separate concerns: draggable items vs droppable containers
<DndContext onDragStart={handleDragStart} onDragEnd={handleDragEnd}>
  <CarDroppable id="car-1">
    <SortableRider id="rider-1" />
  </CarDroppable>
  <UnassignedDroppable>
    <SortableRider id="rider-2" />
  </UnassignedDroppable>
</DndContext>
```

## [2025-07-05] Apartment Assignment Not Showing Up on /apartments

### Bug
- Users assigned to an apartment were still seeing "No Apartment Assignment" on the /apartments page, even though their membership existed in Firestore.
- The bug was caused by the frontend querying the apartments collection for a document with an 'id' field matching the membership's apartmentId, but Firestore document IDs are not stored as a field in the document data.

### Fix
- Updated `useUserApartment` hook to fetch the apartment by its document ID using `getDoc(doc(db, 'apartments', membership.apartmentId))` instead of querying for an 'id' field.
- Also added a check for `isActive` on the apartment document.

### Impact
- Users now correctly see their apartment assignment if they are assigned in Firestore.
- This fix ensures the UI and Firestore data are always in sync for apartment membership.

## üè† Apartment Hosting Feature: Bug Fixes & Implementation Challenges

**Feature**: Apartment Availability Posting System  
**Technology Stack**: Next.js, React, Firebase Firestore, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
**Date**: July 2025  

---

## üìã Executive Summary

The apartment hosting feature enables community members to post and discover open time slots for spontaneous hangouts. This implementation involved solving several critical technical challenges related to timezone handling, form UX, and Firestore data compatibility.

---

## üö® Critical Bugs & Solutions

### 1. **7-Hour Timezone Shift Bug** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Problem**: When users entered times like "2:00 PM", the form would display "7:00 AM" due to a 7-hour timezone conversion.

**Root Cause**: 
- `new Date(value)` was interpreting datetime-local input as UTC
- `toISOString()` was converting to UTC for display
- Pacific Time (UTC-7) caused the 7-hour shift

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE: UTC conversion
const date = new Date(value);
return date.toISOString().slice(0, 16);

// ‚úÖ AFTER: Local timezone handling
const [datePart, timePart] = value.split('T');
const [year, month, day] = datePart.split('-').map(Number);
const [hour, minute] = timePart.split(':').map(Number);
const date = new Date(year, month - 1, day, hour, minute);

// Format in local timezone
const year = date.getFullYear();
const month = String(date.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');
const day = String(date.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
const hours = String(date.getHours()).padStart(2, '0');
const minutes = String(date.getMinutes()).padStart(2, '0');
return `${year}-${month}-${day}T${hours}:${minutes}`;
```

**Lesson**: Always handle timezone conversion explicitly when working with datetime inputs.

---

### 2. **Manual Date Input Fighting with React** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Problem**: Users couldn't type dates manually because React was fighting with the input value, causing cursor jumps and incorrect values.

**Root Cause**: Controlled inputs with `value={...}` were reformatting the input on every change, interfering with manual typing.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE: Controlled input
<input
  value={formData.startTime ? formatDateTime(formData.startTime) : ''}
  onChange={(e) => handleInputChange('startTime', e.target.value)}
/>

// ‚úÖ AFTER: Uncontrolled input
<input
  defaultValue={formData.startTime ? formatDateTime(formData.startTime) : ''}
  onChange={(e) => handleInputChange('startTime', e.target.value)}
/>
```

**Lesson**: Use uncontrolled inputs for complex form fields where users need to type manually.

---

### 3. **Firestore `undefined` Field Error** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL PRIORITY**

**Problem**: `Function addDoc() called with invalid data. Unsupported field value: undefined (found in field maxGuests)`

**Root Cause**: When `maxGuests` field was left empty, it was set to `undefined`, which Firestore doesn't accept.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE: undefined values
maxGuests: undefined

// ‚úÖ AFTER: null values and conditional inclusion
maxGuests: null

// In Firestore submission:
const slotDoc = {
  // ... other fields
  ...(availabilityData.maxGuests !== null && { maxGuests: availabilityData.maxGuests }),
  // ... other fields
};
```

**TypeScript Updates**:
```typescript
// Updated types to allow null
export interface AvailabilityFormData {
  maxGuests?: number | null;
}
```

**Lesson**: Firestore doesn't accept `undefined` values. Use `null` for optional fields and conditionally include them.

---

### 4. **Year Input Not Matching User Typing** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem**: When users typed years manually, the input would show different values than what they typed.

**Root Cause**: The controlled input was reformatting the value immediately, causing the cursor to jump and values to appear incorrect.

**Solution**: Combined with the uncontrolled input fix above, plus proper local timezone formatting.

**Lesson**: Datetime-local inputs need special handling for manual typing scenarios.

---

### 5. **Redundant Card Styling** ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW PRIORITY**

**Problem**: The availability form had its own card styling, but was being rendered inside a modal that already provided card styling, creating a nested card effect.

**Root Cause**: The form component was designed as a standalone card, but was being used inside a modal container.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE: Form with card styling
<form className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-8 flex flex-col gap-6 max-w-xl border border-gray-100">

// ‚úÖ AFTER: Form without card styling
<form className="flex flex-col gap-6">
```

**Lesson**: Consider the context where components will be used. Avoid redundant styling when components are nested.

---

## üîß Technical Implementation Patterns

### Timezone Handling
```typescript
// Always work in local timezone for user inputs
const formatDateTime = (date: Date | undefined) => {
  if (!date || isNaN(date.getTime())) return '';
  const year = date.getFullYear();
  const month = String(date.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');
  const day = String(date.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
  const hours = String(date.getHours()).padStart(2, '0');
  const minutes = String(date.getMinutes()).padStart(2, '0');
  return `${year}-${month}-${day}T${hours}:${minutes}`;
};
```

### Firestore Data Handling
```typescript
// Conditional field inclusion for optional values
const slotDoc = {
  apartmentId: availabilityData.apartmentId,
  apartmentName,
  postedBy,
  postedByEmail,
  postedByName,
  startTime: Timestamp.fromDate(availabilityData.startTime),
  endTime: Timestamp.fromDate(availabilityData.endTime),
  description: availabilityData.description,
  ...(availabilityData.maxGuests !== null && { maxGuests: availabilityData.maxGuests }),
  createdAt: now,
  updatedAt: now,
  isActive: true,
};
```

### Form State Management
```typescript
// Proper null handling for optional fields
const [formData, setFormData] = useState<AvailabilityFormData>({
  apartmentId,
  startTime: new Date(),
  endTime: new Date(Date.now() + 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
  description: '',
  maxGuests: null, // null instead of undefined
});
```

## üêû Apartment Availability Tag Selector & UI Integration (July 2025)

### Problem Description
- Tag selector was not saving or displaying selected tags correctly in apartment availability posts.
- Module resolution error: `use-toast` import path was incorrect, causing build failures.
- Legacy/temp code from apartment-hosting integration cluttered the codebase.

### Solution
- Refactored tag selector to use a 3x2 grid with 6 tags (Snacks, Games, Study, Yap, Quiet, Prayer), ensuring only selected tags are saved and displayed.
- Fixed import path for `use-toast` to resolve module errors.
- Removed unused/legacy files and cleaned up the codebase.

### Key Lessons Learned
- Always verify import paths after moving or integrating code.
- UI/UX improvements should be paired with robust data handling.
- Regularly clean up legacy and temp files to maintain project health.

## üöÄ Vercel Deployment: Lessons Learned & Best Practices (July 2025)

### Problem
Deployments to Vercel failed or authentication broke due to misconfigured environment variables, missing Firebase Auth domains, or confusion about automatic deploys.

### Key Lessons Learned

1. **Environment Variables Must Be Set in Vercel**
   - All Firebase config variables (API key, Auth domain, etc.) must be set in the Vercel dashboard under Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables.
   - Server-side admin variables (private key, client email) must also be set for admin features.

2. **Firebase Auth Domain Configuration**
   - Your Vercel deployment domain (e.g., `your-app.vercel.app`) must be added to the Firebase Console under Authentication ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Authorized domains.
   - For local development, add `localhost` as well.
   - The value of `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` should match the domain your app is running on (use `localhost` locally, Vercel domain in production).

3. **Deployment Workflow**
   - By default, every push to the production branch (e.g., `main`) triggers an automatic deployment on Vercel.
   - Use feature branches for development and only merge to `main` when ready for production.
   - Preview deployments are available for every branch and pull request.
   - You can disable automatic deploys in Vercel settings if you want to deploy manually.

4. **Debugging Deployment Issues**
   - If authentication fails after deployment, check that the deployed domain is in Firebase's authorized domains and that all environment variables are set correctly in Vercel.
   - Case sensitivity in file names (especially in `src/components/ui/`) can cause build failures on Vercel's Linux environment‚Äîalways use lowercase file names.

### Best Practices
- Document all required environment variables in `.env.example` and your README.
- Add new deployment domains to Firebase Auth as soon as you create them.
- Use Vercel's preview deployments to test features before merging to production.
- Regularly review Vercel and Firebase settings after major changes or refactors.

## üöÄ Feature Enhancements: Lessons Learned (July 2025)

### Enhanced Carpool Algorithm with Grade & Gender Matching

#### Problem
The original carpool algorithm only considered location proximity, which could result in cars with homogeneous grade levels and gender imbalances, limiting community building opportunities.

#### Solution Implemented
- **Grade Mixing**: Added grade field to signup forms and algorithm logic to ensure diverse grade levels in each car
- **Gender Balance**: Implemented logic to prioritize having at least 2 females per car when possible
- **Post-Processing Optimization**: Added `optimizeAssignments` function that swaps riders between cars to improve distribution
- **Enhanced Data Collection**: Updated all forms (public and admin) to collect grade and gender information

#### Key Lessons Learned
1. **Algorithm Design**: Post-processing optimization is more effective than trying to build all constraints into the initial assignment
2. **Data Consistency**: When adding new fields, ensure they're added to all related interfaces, forms, and database operations
3. **User Experience**: New required fields should be clearly labeled and have sensible default options
4. **Admin Interface**: Admin forms and data displays should be updated simultaneously with public forms

#### Technical Implementation
- Updated `RideSignup` interface in `carpoolAlgorithm.ts`
- Enhanced `assignCarpools` function with post-processing optimization
- Added grade and gender fields to public signup form (`/events/rides`)
- Updated admin carpool management forms and data display
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing data

### Jam Sesh Tag Addition

#### Problem
Users wanted to indicate when their apartment availability included music/jam sessions, but the existing tag system only had 6 options.

#### Solution Implemented
- Added "Jam Sesh" tag with üé∏ icon to the availability form
- Updated tag mapping in both form and display components
- Maintained the 3-column grid layout (7 tags now span 3 rows)

#### Key Lessons Learned
1. **Tag System Design**: Keep tag options focused and meaningful to users
2. **Icon Selection**: Choose intuitive icons that clearly represent the activity
3. **Grid Layout**: Consider how new tags will affect the visual layout
4. **Consistency**: Update both form and display components to maintain consistency

### Global Navigation System

#### Problem
Users had to manually navigate by typing URLs or use inconsistent navigation patterns across different pages, making the app difficult to use.

#### Solution Implemented
- **Global Navigation Component**: Created `GlobalNavigation.tsx` with persistent header
- **Mobile Hamburger Menu**: Responsive slide-out menu for mobile devices
- **Active Page Indicators**: Visual feedback showing current location
- **Authentication Integration**: Sign in/out functionality integrated into navigation
- **Layout Integration**: Updated main layout to include global navigation

#### Key Lessons Learned
1. **Component Architecture**: Global navigation should be a separate component for maintainability
2. **Authentication State**: Navigation needs to handle loading states and authentication changes gracefully
3. **Mobile-First Design**: Hamburger menus are essential for mobile usability
4. **Active States**: Visual feedback for current page improves user experience
5. **Layout Structure**: Global navigation should be integrated at the layout level, not individual pages

#### Technical Implementation
- Created `GlobalNavigation.tsx` component with mobile responsiveness
- Updated `useAuth` hook to include `signOut` function
- Integrated navigation into main layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Removed duplicate navigation from individual pages (e.g., apartments page)
- Used Next.js App Router for client-side navigation

### Code Quality Improvements

#### Lessons Learned
1. **Import Cleanup**: When removing features, clean up all related imports to prevent build errors
2. **Type Safety**: Always update TypeScript interfaces when adding new fields
3. **Component Reusability**: Global components like navigation should be designed for reuse across the app
4. **Error Handling**: New features should include proper error handling and loading states
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation (PRD, lessons learned) when implementing new features

#### Best Practices Established
- **Feature Documentation**: Document all new features in PRD with implementation details
- **Interface Updates**: When adding fields, update all related interfaces and forms
- **Component Testing**: Test new components across different screen sizes and authentication states
- **Code Review**: Review imports and unused variables when making changes
- **User Experience**: Consider how new features affect the overall user flow
