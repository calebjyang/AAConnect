## üö® Critical Bug: Collection Name Mismatch (July 2025)

### **Problem Description**
Admin dashboard was not displaying ride signups, specifically "Fall Week 1" and other recent signups. Users reported seeing "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors, and even with open Firestore rules, the admin interface showed empty results.

### **Root Cause Analysis**
**Collection Name Inconsistency**: The application was using two different Firestore collection names:
- **Public ride signup form**: Writing to `rides` collection
- **Admin dashboard**: Reading from `rideSignups` collection

This mismatch meant:
- New signups went to `rides` collection
- Admin dashboard looked in `rideSignups` collection
- Result: Admin dashboard showed empty results despite successful signups

### **Debugging Process**

1. **Initial Investigation**: Checked Firestore rules, authentication, and project configuration
2. **Environment Variables**: Verified all Firebase config values were correct
3. **Collection Discovery**: Found the mismatch through code review
4. **Testing**: Confirmed fix by updating admin code to use `rides` collection

### **Solution**
```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE: Admin reading from wrong collection
const querySnapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, 'rideSignups'));

// ‚úÖ AFTER: Admin reading from correct collection
const querySnapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, 'rides'));
```

### **Key Lessons Learned**

1. **Collection Naming Consistency**: Always use the same collection names across your entire application
2. **Systematic Debugging**: When facing "permission" errors, check collection names before diving into complex rule debugging
3. **Code Review**: Regular code reviews can catch these inconsistencies early
4. **Testing Strategy**: Test both write and read operations to ensure data flow works end-to-end

### **Prevention Strategies**
- Use constants for collection names
- Implement collection name validation
- Add integration tests that verify data flow
- Document collection naming conventions

## üéØ Drag-and-Drop Implementation: Bug Fixes & Lessons Learned

**Project**: AAConnect MVP - Carpool Management System  
**Feature**: Admin Drag-and-Drop Carpool Editing  
**Technology Stack**: Next.js, React, @dnd-kit, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
**Date**: July 2025  

---

## üìã Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive debugging journey for implementing a drag-and-drop carpool editing system in AAConnect. The feature allows admins to manually adjust automatic carpool assignments by dragging riders between cars and an unassigned area. The implementation involved solving 8 major technical challenges, providing valuable insights into React state management, drag-and-drop UX, and systematic debugging approaches.

---

## üéØ Feature Requirements

- **Drag riders between cars** - Move passengers between different vehicles
- **Drag to/from unassigned** - Handle overflow riders in a dedicated area
- **Visual feedback** - Clear drag preview that matches original elements
- **Error handling** - Graceful handling of invalid drop scenarios
- **Performance** - Smooth, responsive interactions without lag

---

## üö® Critical Bugs & Solutions

### 1. **Snap-Back Issue** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Problem**: Riders would "snap back" to their original position when dragged out of containers.

**Root Cause**: Incorrect use of `SortableContext` for multi-container drag operations. `SortableContext` is designed for sorting within a single container, not moving items between containers.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG: SortableContext for each car
<SortableContext items={carRiders}>
  <CarDroppable>
    <SortableRider />
  </CarDroppable>
</SortableContext>

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Direct droppable containers
<CarDroppable>
  <SortableRider />
</CarDroppable>
```

**Lesson**: Understand library primitives thoroughly. `SortableContext` ‚â† `useDroppable` - they serve different purposes.

---

### 2. **Disappearing Cards Bug** ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Problem**: Riders would completely disappear when dropped in invalid locations.

**Root Cause**: Incomplete error handling in `handleDragEnd`. Riders were removed from source but not added anywhere, effectively losing data.

**Solution**:
```typescript
function handleDragEnd(event: DragEndEvent) {
  // Remove rider from source
  const rider = removeFromSource(activeId);
  
  // Try to add to destination
  if (isValidDropLocation(overId)) {
    addToDestination(rider, overId);
  } else {
    // ‚ùå MISSING: Revert the move
    revertToOriginalPosition(rider, sourceLocation);
  }
}
```

**Lesson**: Always provide fallback behavior for edge cases. Users will drop items in unexpected places.

---

### 3. **Cannot Drag to Empty Cars** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem**: Empty cars weren't recognized as valid drop targets.

**Root Cause**: Drop zones weren't properly registered for empty containers. Collision detection couldn't find valid targets.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Ensure each car container is a droppable zone
function CarDroppable({ id, children, ...props }) {
  const { setNodeRef } = useDroppable({ id });
  return (
    <div ref={setNodeRef} id={id} {...props}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Lesson**: Drop zones must exist independently of their contents. Empty containers should still be droppable.

---

### 4. **React Rules of Hooks Violation** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem**: "Rules of Hooks" error when calling `useDroppable` inside a map function.

**Root Cause**: React hooks must be called at the top level of components, not inside loops or conditions.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG: Hook in map
{assignments.map((assignment, index) => {
  const { setNodeRef } = useDroppable({ id: `car-${index}` }); // ERROR
  return <div ref={setNodeRef}>...</div>;
})}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Separate component
function CarDroppable({ id, children }) {
  const { setNodeRef } = useDroppable({ id }); // Top level
  return <div ref={setNodeRef}>{children}</div>;
}
```

**Lesson**: Always follow React's Rules of Hooks. Extract hook logic into separate components when needed.

---

### 5. **Oversized/Distorted Drag Preview** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem**: Drag preview was much larger and distorted compared to original elements.

**Root Cause**: `@dnd-kit`'s default overlay renders in a portal without inheriting original context styles.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Custom DragOverlay with exact styling
<DragOverlay>
  {activeId ? (
    <div className="exact-same-styles-as-original">
      {/* Custom content matching original */}
    </div>
  ) : null}
</DragOverlay>
```

**Lesson**: Drag-and-drop libraries often require custom styling for visual consistency.

---

### 6. **Height Changes During Drag** ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW PRIORITY**

**Problem**: Drag preview was shorter than original card.

**Root Cause**: Fixed width constraints (240px) caused text wrapping and height changes.

**Solution**: Removed fixed width, let overlay size naturally.

**Lesson**: Fixed dimensions can break responsive layouts. Let elements size themselves when possible.

---

### 7. **Duplicate Drag Previews** ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW PRIORITY**

**Problem**: Both default and custom overlays showing simultaneously.

**Root Cause**: Original element wasn't hidden during drag.

**Solution**:
```typescript
className={`${isDragging ? 'invisible' : ''}`}
```

**Lesson**: Ensure only one drag preview is visible to avoid confusing UX.

---

### 8. **Cannot Drag to/from Unassigned** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Problem**: Unassigned area wasn't functioning as a drop zone.

**Root Cause**: Unassigned area needed explicit droppable registration.

**Solution**:
```typescript
function UnassignedDroppable({ children }) {
  const { setNodeRef } = useDroppable({ id: 'unassigned' });
  return <div ref={setNodeRef}>{children}</div>;
}
```

**Lesson**: All potential drop destinations must be explicitly registered.

---

## üîß Technical Implementation Patterns

### State Management
```typescript
// Track active drag state
const [activeId, setActiveId] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Immutable state updates
const newAssignments = { ...editingAssignments };
newAssignments.assignments = newAssignments.assignments.map(a => ({
  ...a,
  riders: [...a.riders],
}));
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
// Graceful fallback for invalid drops
if (!validDropLocation) {
  revertToOriginalPosition(rider, sourceLocation);
}
```

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Separate concerns: draggable items vs droppable containers
<DndContext onDragStart={handleDragStart} onDragEnd={handleDragEnd}>
  <CarDroppable id="car-1">
    <SortableRider id="rider-1" />
  </CarDroppable>
  <UnassignedDroppable>
    <SortableRider id="rider-2" />
  </UnassignedDroppable>
</DndContext>
```
